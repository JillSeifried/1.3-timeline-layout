<h3>Ricebean black-eyed pea</h3>

<hr></>

<p>The black-eyed pea, black-eyed bean or goat pea, a legume, is a subspecies of
   the cowpea, grown around the world for its medium-sized, edible bean.  The
   common commercial variety is called the California Blackeye; it is
   pale-colored with a prominent black spot. In the American South there are
   countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small
   lady peas to very large ones, as may be seen in the state and municipal
   farmers' markets. The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink or
   green. All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when
   dried. A popular variation of the black-eyed pea is the purple hull pea; it
   is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently
   accepted botanical name for the black-eyed pea is Vigna unguiculata subsp.
   unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus.
   Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and Vigna
   unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean.
   Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra
   (goat's eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called
   black-eyed peas, and vice versa.

<h3>Greens radish arugula</h1>
  <hr></>
<p>If you ever see a salad green referred to as “rocket,” it’s simply another
  name for arugula, or roquette in French. Yet another brassicaceae along with
  kale and cauliflower, its delightfully pungent leaves have been cultivated in
  the Mediterranean since time was recorded. As such, arugula is a perennial
  favorite in Italian cooking.</p>
